# Skitter
A web application made on a micro service architecture. 
HTML for the java application is located at: "Skitter/src/main/resources".

For each feature you plan on adding please create a seperate feature branch with "git branch {name}".  After you complete some work run "git add ." and "git commit -m "{your commit message here"}".  After this run "git push origin {branch name}" and create a pull request on Github.  Finally we can review the code and merge with master.
